# NetDevOps Demo  
These are a collection of experimental scripts for network operations automation.These scripts will do the followingï¼š  

-**Configuration management:** The network automation Agent can be used to manage and maintain the configuration information of network devices.It can automatically collect, back up, compare and restore the configuration of network devices, ensuring that the devices are always in the correct state.    

-**Fault detection and diagnosis:** The Agent can monitor the performance and status of network devices, detect potential faults and provide alerts.  

-**Automatic task execution:** The Agent can perform various automatic tasks, such as periodically backing up configurations, updating software versions, and adjusting performance parameters.  

-**Security and Compliance:** Network Automation Agents can monitor network security events, enforce security policies, and ensure compliance of network devices.  

-**Resource optimization:** The Agent can monitor the usage of network resources and dynamically adjust the configuration based on requirements to achieve the optimal utilization of resources.   

-**Process automation:** The Agent can automatically execute complex workflows, such as the deployment, expansion, and upgrade of network devices. This helps streamline operations and reduce human errors.  

-**Logs and reports:** The Agent generates detailed logs and reports to record network activities and performance indicators.   

-**Dynamic adaptability:** The Agent dynamically adjusts configurations and policies based on network load, topology changes, and performance requirements to ensure that the network flexibly ADAPTS to changing environments.
